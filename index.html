<p>Welcome to my webpage! </p>
<h4>About Me</h4>
<p>I love watching gymnastics. <a

<p> I love dogs. Pictured below is my first dog,<strong> Keesha. </strong></p>

<p>I love to read. The following is an excerpt from one of my favorite books, <em> Emma,</em> by Jane Austin. This long speech made by Mr. Woodhouse before going to a dinner party is similar to the dread I feel before having to leave my house.</P>
<p id="highlight"><em>"The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home- and the folly of people's not staying comfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;-and here we are, probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature, which tells man, in ever thing given to his view or his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man's house,with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow;-four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home."</em>
